                      Why is that so because the travel restrictions are less to the two countries and is not that significant in compare
                      to other countries. Not only that but other factors such as vaccination rate and herd immunity may have been reached

                      However in 2020 they mainly use Airbus A350-900 as it is more cost efficient to operate on as the engine can go further then the 777-300ER.</p>
